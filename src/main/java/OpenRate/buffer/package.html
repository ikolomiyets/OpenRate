    Buffers are used in OpenRate to link modules together in a chain - the buffer
    is used as the way of ensuring that plugins are kept under load during 
    processing, by making sure that the output of the <i>supplier</i> plug in 
    and the input of the <i>consumer</i> plug in are decoupled. <p>
    The buffer that is used is a standard FIFO, which preserves order between
    the records.<p>
