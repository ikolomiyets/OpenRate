    File adapters read data from files and write data back to files. This is
    perhaps the easiest and fastest way to manage external data in OpenRate.

    File adapaters are able to work in a multi-transaction mode, meaning that
    the framework is able to open many files at once (and therefore also manage
    many transactions at once, as each file runs in its own transaction) in
    order to maintain the processing performance through the pipeline. (Recall
    that maximum performance will be reached when ALL plugins are running at the
    same moment, something that is not possible with single transactions and
    small files.
