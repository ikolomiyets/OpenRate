/**
 * Socket Listener InputAdapter (Non transactional Version) The basic function
 * of this flat file input adapter is to facilitate a reading of a flat file in
 * the batches, instead of reading a whole file in a single fetch.
 *
 * The file input adapter scans for files, and when found, opens them, reads
 * them and turns them into batches to maintain the load on the pipeline.
 *
 * Scanning and Processing -----------------------
 *
 * The basic scanning and processing loop looks like this: - The loadBatch()
 * method is called regularly by the execution model, regardless of if there is
 * work in progress or not. - If we are not processing a file, we are allowed to
 * scan for a new file to process - If we are allowed to look for a new file to
 * process, we do this: - getInputAvailable() Scan to see if there is any work
 * to do - assignInput() marks the file as being in processing if we find work
 * to do open the input stream - Calculate the file names from the base name -
 * Open the file reader - Inject the synthetic HeaderRecord into the stream as
 * the first record to synchronise the processing down the pipe
 *
 * - If we are processing a stream, we do: - Read the records in from the
 * stream, creating a basic "FlatRecord" for each record we have read - When we
 * have finished reading the batch (either because we have reached the batch
 * limit or because there are no more records to read) call procValidRecord(),
 * which allows the user to perform preparation of the record (for example,
 * creating the user defined record from the generic FlatRecord, or performing
 * record compression on the incoming stream) - See if the file reader has run
 * out of records. It it has, this is the end of the stream. If it is the end of
 * the stream, we do: - Inject a trailer record into the stream - close the
 * input stream and reset the "file in processing" flag so that we can scan for
 * more files
