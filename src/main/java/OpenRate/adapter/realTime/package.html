    The real time adapter is used for communicating with OpenRate via a
    multi-threaded socket interface. Each client can open a socket to the
    OpenRate framework and can send processing requests through the real time
    mode of the pipeline, which gives processing priority to these events. The
    response will be passed back to the socket thread which requested the
    information, giving the appearance of a dedicated connection.
