/**
 * Generic Object InputAdapter.
 *
 * The basic function of this input adapter is to read a collection of objects
 * that are presented to an input "listener" function - in reality it does not
 * listen, but instead accepts a series of records that presented as a
 * collection to the input adapter.
 *
 * Because this adapter uses the transactional parent class, the adapter is
 * transaction aware, and communicates with the parent transactional layer
 * communicates with the transaction manager to coordinate the file processing.
 *
 *   Processing
 *   ----------
 *
 * The basic processing loop looks like this:
 * - When a new batch of records is presented to the input adapter, then are
 *   read in the block size that is defined in the input adapter. For real-time
 *   work, it is normally better to choose smaller block sizes to reduce the
 *   latency through the processing pipe.
 * - Read the records in from the stream, creating a basic "FlatRecord" for
 *   each record we have read
 * - When we have finished reading the batch (either because we have reached
 *   the batch limit or because there are no more records to read) call the
 *   abstract transformInput(), which  is a user definable method in the
 *   implementation class which transforms the generic FlatRecord read from
 *   the file into a record for the processing
 * - See if there are any more records to process. If there are no more,
 *   this is the end of the stream. If it is the end of the stream, we do:
 *   - Inject a trailer record into the stream
 *   - Call the transaction layer to set the transaction status to "Flushed"
 *
 * The transaction closing is performed by the transaction layer, which is
 * informed by the transaction manager of changes in the overall status of the
 * transaction. When a change is made, the updateTransactionStatus() method
 * is called.
 *  - When all of the modules down the pipe have reported that they have FLUSHED
 *    the records, the flushTransaction() method is called, causing the input
 *    stream to be closed and the state of the transaction to be set to either
 *    FINISHED_OK or FINISHED_ERR
 *  - If the state went to FINISHED_OK, we commit the transaction, and rename
 *    the input file to have the final "done" name, else it is renamed to the
 *    "Err" name.
 *
 * The input adapter is also able to process more than one file at a time. This
 * is to allow the efficient operation of long pipelines, where a commit might
 * not arrive until a long time after the input adapter has finished processing
 * the input file. In this case, successive transactions can be opened before
 * the preceeding transaction is closed.
