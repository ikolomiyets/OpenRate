/**
 * The buffer input adapter allows us to link pipelines together using buffers.
 * In particular, this is useful for adding persistence to a real time pipeline
 * where the writing to a table or file should happen after real time processing
 * has happened.
 *
 * This module tees into a Real Time pipeline and takes a feed of the events
 * for putting into a batch pipeline. This is usually used for persistence
 * of RT events in a batch mode, however, it can also be used for balance
 * updates in a batch pipeline.
 *
 * Buffer Input Adapter
 * --------------------
 * The output of the buffer tee adapter allows you to "sniff" events out of
 * a pipeline (real time or batch) and put them into another pipeline (batch)
 * for persistence or further processing. This converts synchronous events into
 * asynchronous events. The coupling between the two pipelines is a normal FIFO
 * buffer. The buffer is accessed using a "LinkedBufferCache" which allows the
 * FIFO to be set up and accessed by name.
