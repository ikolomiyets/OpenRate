    JDBC adapters read and write data from databases using JDBC connections using
    a standard processing strategy. The processing strategy is carefully chosen
    in order to ensure that records can be written to the input table in a
    continuous flow, and these will eb excluded from the processing transaction
    until it is time for a new transaction to start. This means that the
    transaction size is held constant by the framework, and concurrency issues
    are reduced to a minimum.

    Input strategy:
     - Search to see if any records are available for processing in the source table
     - If records are available, mark then as belonging to a transaction
     - Process all records in the transaction.
     - If the transaction completed correctly, marks the records as "read", or remove them
     - If the transaction went badly, leave the records where they are or mark them as errored
