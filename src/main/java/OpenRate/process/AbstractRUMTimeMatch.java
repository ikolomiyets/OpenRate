/**
 * This class implements a time zoning and splitting module, based on the RUM
 * rating model. That means that Charge Packets are evaluated during the
 * processing and the results are generally written back to the Charge Packet.
 *
 * This module performs splitting in the following cases: - The Splitting Flag
 * in the Charge Packet has to be set to a value which indicates that splitting
 * is required: - 0 = no splitting - 1 = splitting equally of the duration over
 * the packets
 *
 * Splitting is done on the duration of the call, and the results of the
 * splitting operation are written into the "splittingFactor" field of the
 * charge packet. This double value indicates the fractional amount of the RUM
 * value which should be written into this charge packet.
 *
 * The duration of the call is taken from the RUMValue field, and this is
 * interpreted as the duration of the call. In cases where you do not want the
 * RUMValue interpreted as the duration, do NOT set the splitting flag. No
 * filtering is done on the RUM type, only the splitting flag is significant.
 *
 * This module can create many charge packets out of each 'seed' charge packet,
 * one for each zone that has been impacted. Zones of a similar type (e.g.
 * 'peak' or 'off-peak' are not aggregated, but instead are presented as
 * individual segments of validity, and should be rolled-up if necessary after
 * rating.
 *
 * Fields Read: - Charge Packet:timeModel - Charge Packet:Valid - Charge
 * Packet:timeSplitting - Charge Packet:priority - RatingRecord:EventDate
 *
 * Fields Written: - Charge Packet:timeResult - Charge Packet:timeSplitting -
 * Charge Packet:splittingFactor
