 * The rating is performed on the Charge Packets that should already be and
 * should have the "priceGroup" field filled with an appropriate value. Usually
 * the priceGroup value is retrieved using the zoning and timing results. Note
 * that the number of Charge Packets can (and often will) increase during the

 * will be created for each of these resource impacts (in the case that multiple

 * No roll-up of charges is performed in this module. You can use the module
 * "GatherRUMImpacts" to collect and create a summary of the CP impacts.
 *
 * You can obtain a rating breakdown (which provides exact details of the steps
 * and tiers used to calculate the charge) by enabling the standard rating
 * record field "CreateBreakdown" boolean value to true.
