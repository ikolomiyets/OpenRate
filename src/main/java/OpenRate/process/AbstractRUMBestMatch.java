/**
 * This class implements a zoning module, based on the RUM rating model.
 * That means that Charge Packets are evaluated during the processing and the
 * results are generally written back to the Charge Packet.
 *
 * This module performs splitting in the following cases:
 *  - The Splitting Flag in the Charge Packet has to be set to a value which
 *    indicates that splitting is required:
 *    - 0 = no splitting
 *    - 1 = splitting equally of the duration over the packets
 *
 * The duration of the call is taken from the RUMValue field, and this is
 * interpreted as the duration of the call. In cases where you do not want
 * the RUMValue interpreted as the duration, do NOT set the splitting flag. No
 * filtering is done on the RUM type, only the splitting flag is significant.
 *
 * This module can create many charge packets out of each 'seed' charge packet,
 * one for each zone that has been impacted. Zones of a similar type (e.g.
 * 'peak' or 'off-peak' are not aggregted, but instead are presented as
 * individual segements of validity, and should be rolled-up if necessary after
 * rating.
 *
 * Fields Read:
 *  - Charge Packet:zoneModel
 *  - Charge Packet:Valid
 *  - Charge Packet:priority
 *  - Parameter:Destination
 *
 * Fields Written:
 *  - Charge Packet:zoneResult
