 * 
 * InitializationEceptions are reserved for exceptions that occur during

 * 
 * Parameters:
 *  - The message text (mandatory): The descriptive text of the error
 *  - The module name (mandatory): The OpenRate module that reported the

 *      module with "getSymbolicName().
 *  - The cause (optional): The exception or throwable which caused the
