/**
 * The handler class is designed for dealing with failures during plug in
 * processing. Since plug ins are executed within one or more threads, they
 * cannot propagate errors up the call stack to the main thread. To remedy
 * this problem, the ExceptionHandler is made available to all processing 
 * elements as a way to report critical processing errors. It is shared by all
 * the threads (including the main thread running the pipeline) and is checked
 * at the end of each cycle so that application shutdown can happen cleanly as 
 * soon as possible. This is a common pattern for error reporting in a multi-
 * threaded environment.
 * 
 * The exception handling strategy in OpenRate is ("*" means that this element
 * has an exception handler and deals with exceptions from all lower levels):
 * 
 * Framework(*)
 *  |
 *  +---Resources
 *  |
 *  +---Pipe(*)
 *       |
 *       +---Input Adapter
 *       |
 *       +---processing Modules
 *       |
 *       +---Output Adapter(s)
 * 
 * - This then means that exceptions that are caused as processing or 
 *   initialisation in a pipeline are normally reported to the exception handler
 *   for the pipeline. These are then reported in the Error log and/or the
 *   pipeline log.
 * 
 * - Exceptions that happen in Caches or other resources normally are reported 
 *   to the exception handler for the framework. These are reported to the Error
 *   log and/or the Framework log.
 * 
 * Normal run time log messages (for exceptions that are "expected" or 
 * functional application level error messages are not to be reported via
 * exception, but by writing to the log directly.
 * 
 * In order to keep the pipeline and framework logs clean, we report the
 * exception text to the log, and the stack trace to the Error log. In a well
 * running system, the Error log should remain empty.
 * 
 * Any exceptions thrown in modules that are not directly part of the above 
 * structure (e.g. Utilities or records) are not to report to the exception
 * handler directly, but instead propagate the exception back up to the
 * relevant pipeline or framework level for reporting there. 
 * 
 * NOTE: This does not mean that you can't report exceptions in a record. It 
 * means only that the reporting to an exception handler must be managed at
 * pipe or framework level. There is therefore no need to have access to an
 * exception handler at record or Utility level!
