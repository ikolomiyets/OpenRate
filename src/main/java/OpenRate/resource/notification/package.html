    The Notification package contains the OpenRate notification infrastructure,
    which can be used to asyncronously trigger notifications to external
    systems. A common use of this is for triggering fraud notifications
    when a daily spend balance is crossed. In order to maintain processing
    performance, notifications are queued for delivery and delivered 
    asynchronously.
    
    A synchronous notification method is also implemented for the case that
    the delivery of the notification is absolutely essential. This therefore
    blocks the processing until the notification is delivered.
