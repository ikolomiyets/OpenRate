   * The record definition is like this:
   * BLOCKPATH;BLOCK;NEWBLOCKNAME;FIELDCOUNT; defines a new block
   * BLOCKPATH;FIELD;FIELDNUMBER;FIELDNAME;FIELDTYPE; defines a new field in the block
   *

   *  + -- NAME (String)
   *  |

   *        + CHILDSEX (String)
   *        |
   *        + CHILDAGE (int)

   * we would have the following configuration:
   *
   * ROOT;BLOCK;ROOT;2
   * ROOT;FIELD;1;NAME;STRING
   * ROOT;FIELD;2;AGE;INTEGER
   * ROOT;FIELD;2;AGE;INTEGER
   * ROOT;BLOCK;CHILDREN;3

   * ROOT.CHILDREN;FIELD;2;CHILDSEX;STRING
   * ROOT.CHILDREN;FIELD;3;CHILDAGE;INTEGER
   *
   * The FlexRecordFactory also performs mappings from an external record
   * to a FlexRecord.
   *
   * A map definition is composed of any number of
   * BLOCKPATH;MAP;OFFSET;MAPTOFIELD
   *
   * A separator is also defined
   * MAPNAME;SEPARATOR;";"
   *
   * There will be a "MAP" entry for every field in the input record that
   * you wish to map. Data you do not wish to map can be ignored. The entry
   * "MAPTOFIELD" is the integer offset of the field in the input record.
