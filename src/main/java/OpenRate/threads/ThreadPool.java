/**
 * Custom IThreadPool Implementation. The IThreadPool is started with predefined
 * set of WorkerThreads which actually perform the work.
 *
 * This IThreadPool is suitable for scenarios work is split across
 * mutiple threads and main thread waits for all the worker threads to
 * finish and assigns work to all (or part) of worker threads.
 *
 * The IThreadPool can be asked to find a worked thread and assign work to it using
 * execute method. Using join() method the caller will wait for all the worker
 * threads to finish.
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTE(S):
 *
 * 1. This IThreadPool is suitable for use by a single thread, not by mutliple
 *    threads/requests    requesting IThreadPool to execute work.
 * 2. It is the responsibility of the caller to make sure that it requests at
 *    maximum 'poolsize' amount of work to be performed by the IThreadPool.
 *    If no workers are free an RuntimeException is thrown.
